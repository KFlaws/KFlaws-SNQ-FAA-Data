  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Perspective-taking (PT) is an important skill children develop within the first few years of life; however, little is known about how children's social environments relate to PT development. During early childhood, children's social networks undergo dramatic growth. Prior work with adults has shown that network size is related to PT skill, which raises the question of whether and how children's social networks may relate to their emerging PT skills. This question is particularly interesting given that children's social worlds undergo dramatic growth and changes, which is a sharp contrast from adults that have stable social network sizes. The present study measured the social networks of 3-year-old children ({$<$}italic{$>$}n{$<$}/italic{$>$} = 36; 15 female; 68\% White) and found that children in larger social networks demonstrated stronger PT skills, particularly on the more difficult trials on the task. These results indicate the size of children's social networks relates to their PT ability.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Those selected (N = 153) were assessed at multiple age points across the first 4 years of life for behavioral signs of inhibition as well as psychophysiological markers of frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) asymmetry. Four-month temperament was modestly predictive of behavioral inhibition over the first 2 years of life and of behavioral reticence at age 4. Those infants who remained continuously inhibited displayed right frontal EEG asymmetry as early as 9 months of age while those who changed from inhibited to noninhibited did not. Change in behavioral inhibition was related to experience of nonparental care. A second group of infants, selected at 4 months of age for patterns of behavior thought to predict temperamental exuberance, displayed a high degree of continuity over time in these behaviors.},

  abstract = {Asymmetric patterns of frontal brain electrical activity reflect approach and avoidance tendencies, with stability of relative right activation associated with withdrawal emotions/motivation and left hemisphere activation linked with approach and positive affect. However, considerable shifts in approach/avoidance-related lateralization have been reported for children not targeted because of extreme temperament. In this study, dynamic effects of frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) power within and across hemispheres were examined throughout early childhood. Specifically, EEG indicators at 5, 10, 24, 36, 48, and 72 months-of-age (n = 410) were analyzed via a hybrid of difference score and panel design models, with baseline measures and subsequent time-to-time differences modeled as potentially influencing all subsequent amounts of time-to-time change (i.e., predictively saturated). Infant sex was considered as a moderator of dynamic developmental effects, with temperament attributes measured at 5 months examined as predictors of EEG hemisphere development. Overall, change in left and right frontal EEG power predicted declining subsequent change in the same hemisphere, with effects on the opposing neurobehavioral system enhancing later growth. Infant sex moderated the pattern of within and across-hemisphere effects, wherein for girls more prominent left hemisphere influences on the right hemisphere EEG changes were noted and right hemisphere effects were more salient for boys. Largely similar patterns of temperament prediction were observed for the left and the right EEG power changes, with limited sex differences in links between temperament and growth parameters. Results were interpreted in the context of comparable analyses using parietal power values, which provided evidence for unique frontal effects.},

Analyses revealed that more left asymmetry predicted later activity level across the first 3 years. Conversely, asymmetry did not predict fear. Rather, fear at 36 months predicted more right asymmetry at 48 months.

  abstract = {Fearful inhibition and impulsivity-anger significantly predict internalizing and externalizing problems, respectively. An important moderator that may affect these associations is frontal EEG asymmetry (FA). We examined how temperament and FA at 6 years interactively predicted behavioral problems at 9 years. A community sample of 186 children (93 boys, 93 girls) participated in the study. Results indicated that the effect of fearful inhibition on parent-reported internalizing problems increased as children exhibited greater right FA. The effect of impulsivity-anger on parent-reported externalizing problems increased as children showed greater left FA. Because FA was allowed to vary rather than children being dichotomized into membership in left FA and right FA groups, we observed that children's FA contributed to the resilience process only when FA reached specific asymmetry levels. These findings highlight the importance of considering the different functions of FA in combination with specific dimensions of temperament in predicting children's socioemotional outcomes. Clinical implications include providing suggestions for intervention services by demonstrating the role of FA in developing behavioral problems and inspiring research on whether it is possible to alter EEG activation and thus potentially improve developmental outcomes.},

Yet, this topic has been understudied in adolescents despite the critical developmental and maturational changes that occur during this period and the relevance of social motivation to clinical and neurodevelopmental disorders. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and an implicit-association paradigm (Choose-A-Movie Task; Dubey et al., 2015), we examined how brain responses underlying socially motivated decisions informed future decisions in 54 youth (aged 10--14 years) and 50 young adults (aged 18--33 years). As the first study to use this task during EEG recording, we implemented time-frequency analyses and a trial-by-trial dynamic statistical approach. Results suggested that both age groups preferred low-effort choices and increasingly preferred nonsocial choices over time. P3 amplitude also increased over time and was sensitive to effortful decisions, particularly for adults, but not social content. Both groups showed larger leftward frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) during nonsocial feedback, and FAA predicted future decisions differently for adults than youth. The current study highlights FAA and trial-by-trial analyses as useful tools in understanding the neural mechanisms underlying socially motivated decisions, which differ across development, time, and individuals.},
