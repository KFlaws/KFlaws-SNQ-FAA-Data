My thesis is looking at the relationship between social network size and frontal alpha asymmetry to strangers during infancy and the possible moderation effects of temperamental fear.

My study examines the relationship between social network sizes and neural responses to strangers during infancy. We use an infant’s frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) as an indicator of the infant’s neural response to strangers. Given the positive relation between social network sizes and children’ social cognition (Burke et al., 2023; Downey & Condron, 2004), we predict that larger social network size will correlate with more positive FAA (i.e. increased left frontal activation) toward strangers. 
The second question we are interested in is how temperament, especially fear, can moderate the relationship between social network size and responses to strangers during infancy. There are three possibilities. First, a high level of fear may weaken the relationship between social network size and an infant’s neural response to strangers. Second, a high level of fear may magnify the relationship between social network size and an infant’s neural response to strangers. The third possibility is that there is no influence of fear on the relationship between social network size and an infant's neural responses to strangers.
